    },
    {
      question: "What is your design process?",
      answer: "My design process typically consists of five key phases: Discovery (understanding the problem and user needs), Research (market and user research), Ideation (sketching and conceptualizing solutions), Design (creating wireframes, prototypes, and visual designs), and Testing & Iteration (validating designs with users and refining based on feedback). I adapt this process to meet each project's specific needs."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a typical project take?",
      answer: "Project timelines vary significantly depending on scope, complexity, and requirements. A simple website redesign might take 2-4 weeks, while a comprehensive app design could take 2-3 months. During our initial consultation, I'll provide a more accurate timeline based on your specific project needs and objectives."
    },
    {
      question: "What deliverables can I expect?",
      answer: "Depending on the project scope, deliverables typically include wireframes, interactive prototypes, visual designs, style guides, design specifications, and asset files. For ongoing collaborations, I can also provide design system documentation and component libraries. I work with tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch to deliver files in formats that work best for your team."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you charge for your services?",
      answer: "I offer several pricing models to accommodate different client needs: project-based fixed pricing, hourly rates, retainer agreements for ongoing work, and value-based pricing for larger initiatives. After understanding your project requirements, I'll recommend the most appropriate pricing structure for your specific situation."
    },
    {
      question: "Are you available for freelance design?",
      answer: "Yes, I'm available for freelance projects and consultations. I work with both startups and established companies on projects of various sizes. Whether you need a complete design solution or specialized expertise to supplement your team, I can adapt to your requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I download your resume/CV?",

    {
      question: "What tools do you use?",
      answer: "I'm proficient in industry-standard design tools including Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, InVision, and Protopie. I also have working knowledge of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript to better collaborate with development teams."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you do branding as well as UX/UI design?",
      answer: "Yes, I offer branding services that complement my UX/UI design work. This includes logo design, brand identity development, style guides, and ensuring brand consistency across digital products. A cohesive approach to branding and product design creates a more harmonious user experience."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle revisions?",
